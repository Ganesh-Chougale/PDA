# Clever father son duo  
```txt
Once a rich man in his mid 40s was dying.
He called his son at last breath time & tell everyone to leave them alone.

He told his son: as my dying wish. Tell everyone that the cause of my death is Aids instead of cancer. I took care of artificial papers works by telling the doctor.

Son surprised by this. Asked him why he wants to die infamously? People will bad mouth him after his death.

Father replied: the reason is, after knowing Aids is the cause of my death. No men will try to marry your mother. Resulting no new sibling to you to share property. It is a win to both of us.

Son agreed to that.

Many years passed & son became successful businessman.  

One of his friend asked for loan from him & the amount was 80k. To keep friendship son gave his friend a loan with formal paper agreement. After few days he realized that he accidentally burned those loan papers with other scrap papers.

But he was a clever son of a clever father. He emailed his friend & said "when are you going to repay 120k that I gave you?"

His friend immediately raged & replied his email & texted. "You only gave me 80k not 120k". This way now son has proof that came from friend's side that he lended 80k to his friend.  

A lying technique that profits you & do not loss others.

# The Job Interview Trick  

A young guy went for a high-profile job interview. Dozens of candidates were ahead of him, all equally qualified.

At the final round, the CEO asked a tricky question to everyone:

> “Why should we hire you and not them?”

Most candidates answered with achievements, skills, and boasting.

This guy instead smiled and said:

> “Sir, if you don’t hire me, that’s fine. But when my competitor company hires me, you’ll end up competing against me anyway. Would you prefer me working for you, or against you?”

The CEO was stunned—he didn’t claim to be the *best*, he made the CEO *fear losing him to rivals*.

Result → The CEO hired him on the spot.

That’s next-level genius because:

* He didn’t attack others (no harm).
* He positioned himself as *too valuable to lose*.
* It’s a win-win: CEO feels smart for securing him, and he gets the job.
