# The Art Of Learning  

## Learn by doing  
the most effective way to learn something is 30% learn 80% apply.  
to explain it with example.  
A pot master has 2 groups of students under him. & he decides to conduct a social experiment. 
- to 1st group he told that firt learn each IFs & BUTs of pottery. look for beautiful patterns. make a picture perfect plan to create a pots & then create them.  
- to 2nd group he told that make atleat 1 pot a day, learn from previous mistake & try to never repeat that mistake again.  
after a month he checked at the result. the 2nd group made singificantly better pots than 1st group.  
1st group was looking for perfection, while 2nd group was getting grilled in actual process.  
But know your playground first. in most of cases 2nd group process fits. but in sensitive cases where life or finance is at stake demands some necessary aspect of knowledge first. decide on what you losing after mistakes. a bad product instance, a bad draft of work? then go for 2nd method. if it dangers your life, livelyhood or finance then gathering bare minimum information is must. these things will vary.  
But one thing thats not going anywhere is kickstart, start doing things.   

## DOs & DON'Ts  
### 1. DOs
1. Get to know where you are right now.  
2. Plan gradual learning.  
3. Make a list of Phases & Steps inside that phases.  
here goal is to set small achievable goal. a small bites that fits in current mouth size. completing small achievable goals makes us feel good, knowledgeable & most important cofident.  
4. Document progress & lessons. 

### 2. DON'Ts  
1. Never start arbitrarily. there is no point to learn over-complex thing from right at begining. or no point in learning foundations or basic over & over again.  
2. Never do Un-organised learning, it is interest killer.  
3. Never bite more than you chew. this makes us feels overwhelmed. its our job to never get overwhelmed at any cost.  

### 3. Built own DOs & DON'Ts  
above 2 points are generelized DOs & DON'Ts in art of learning, but each individual topics has thier own DOs & DON'Ts. so get to know them & built own list from that.  

## Know your source    
The most crucial part of learning anything is `source`.  
the most common source of learning are Books. but i would say any signs, traces & documentation that keep records can be called as source.  
for example the fossils are sources of Pre-Historic era information, paintings from cave walls are sources of Stone-Age era information, stone-tablets are sources of Ancient-Times information. similirly old buidlings, temples or ruins are source of imformation of that perticular time. And as we all knows Books are modern & most robust source of all time. Modern era has E-books, Papers, Media like Audio-books, Documentary vidoes, Podcast & what not as source.   
but but but  
knowing who is writer/author/creator of the source is more crucial that anything.  
1. A historical writter who is memeber of perticular political party will always represent history which will favour his own party or bash opposition party/wing though his writtings. that writter will re-write & white wash character that were bad, defame character which were good. anything that propogate well-being of his/her narrative will be done.  
2. A college teacher who has his/her own private tution on same subject will never teach that subject with full efforts at college.  

suppose you want a sage as your guru. where you will look for him?  
A. dont't just pick nearest option to you.
B. if you pick most famouse person from town or state. mostly he is capitalist with better reach.  
C. then you might think real sage only found at mountain range like himalaya or jungle. but again silence doesn't means wisdom. Hiding in caves can be escapism.  
so what are parameters of legitmacy?
- Humility: admits “I don’t know.”
- Integrity: words match actions, over years.
- Freedom: not hooked on fame, money, or followers—can walk away.
- Clarity: leaves you saner, kinder, more effective.
- Service: lifts others without creating dependency.

same things apply on sources
