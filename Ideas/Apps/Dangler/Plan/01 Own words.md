1. Individuals: suppose we have a historical person like a Michael Jackson. his life span will represented as a vertical rope/pipe/tube, he born in 1958, so his rope/pipe/tube will start with a knot (his birth date) then rope/pipe/tube continues down. but at every major points of his life his rope/pipe/tube will have a knot for that. like his first song release date is (13-july-1967) so his life rope have the knot on that date, when we click on that date it will open the detailed information about that event (text information, photos, media or embedded file). a knot for his marriage, a knot for his children, a final knot will be his death.
