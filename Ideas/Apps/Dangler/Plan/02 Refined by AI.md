## **Dangler – Concept Summary**

**Core Idea:**
A dynamic, visual timeline app where the life or history of any entity—people, companies, products, animals, or ideologies—is represented as a vertical rope/pipe/tube. Major events appear as **knots** along the rope. Clicking a knot reveals detailed information (text, images, media).
